  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Missing Vendor Name Checker is an app designed to help merchants identify products
    that are missing vendor information inside their store.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Access</h2>

  <p>The app accesses the following store data through the Shopify Admin API:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Product information (read-only)</li>
    <li>Store identification information required for authentication</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>

  <p>
    Product data is accessed only to perform on-demand scans initiated by the merchant.
    Scan results are displayed inside the Shopify Admin interface.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>

  <p>The app stores minimal operational data required for functionality, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Store identifier</li>
    <li>Scan run metadata</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Scan metadata is retained only as long as necessary to support app functionality
    and troubleshooting, and is not used for analytics or profiling.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the app is uninstalled, any stored operational data associated with the store
    is deleted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app does not store customer personal data and does not modify store data.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

  <p>
    The app does not sell, share, or transfer store data to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
